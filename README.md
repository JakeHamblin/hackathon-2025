# The Holy Schnikes

## What is this project?

This project was built in late January of 2025 during the Make-IT-Wright Hackathon sponsored by the Wright State Alumni Association. During this time, students were given a 24 hour period to create a engineering project. This project was a piano staircase created using ultrasonic sensors to be used in the Russ Engineering atrium staircase.

## What did this project accomplish?

A working staircase concept was created. While not perfect, with some edge case sensor readings and sound spamming occuring, the proof of concept was demonstrated for how the ultrasonic sensors would work in detecting individuals walking up stairs.


## Members
- Cade Mason (Electrical Engineer, Hardware)
- Jake Hamblin (Computer Science, Hardware/Software)
- Joshua Quaintance (Computer Science, Software)
- Carter Mansell (Electical Engineer, Hardware/DJ)
- Tyler Sowards (Electrical Engineer, Hardware)


## Goal

Build a three step example of the piano staircase in homage to the Boffin project. 
Use HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. Use a Raspberry Pi connected to HC-SR04 sensors.

Have Fun!


## Future Improvements
1. Sleep mode and have motion sensor turn on the system.
2. Audio Uploader - allow more customization of sounds playing from each step
